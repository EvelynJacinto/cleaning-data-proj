This repository contains my solution to the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project in Coursera.

The data set "UCI\_HAR.txt" is created when run\_analysis.R is executed in R. The input data set is contained in "UCI HAR Dataset" directory. This directory must contain the following:

* activity_labels.txt
* features.txt
* test folder that contains: subject\_test.txt, X\_test.txt, y\_test.txt
* train folder that contains: subject\train.txt, X\_train.txt, y\_train.txt

In order to reproduce the results, the R working directory must be set to the  directory containing "UCI HAR Dataset". The output file "UCI\_HAR.txt" will be created in the working directory.
